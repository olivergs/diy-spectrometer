# diy-spectrometer
DIY Spectrometer based on PublicLab.org instructions from https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/8.5x11mini-spec3.8.pdf

## FreeCad files
There are two FreeCad files. One is the box, and one is the cap. 
Each has been also exported to STL for easier 3D printing with Cura

## Examples:
There are two examples in the examples folder, captured with my cellphone camera using this device.
You can use them to calibrate and play around in https://spectralworkbench.org/dashboard
